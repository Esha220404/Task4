Project implementation

B. To-do list aap with local storage

As part of my internship experience, I built a fully functional to-do list application that integrates with localStorage. I implemented features like adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed, all while maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.

c. A product listing page with filtering and sorting option

In addition to the to-do app, I also developed a dynamic product listing page. This project included interactive filtering by category and sorting options based on price and rating, giving users control over how they view and organize the products. The interface updates in real-time based on the selected filters and sort criteria, improving the overall user experience.

Both projects were designed with responsive layouts, making them accessible and visually appealing on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. Through these projects, I gained practical experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and strengthened my understanding of core front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, data persistence, and user interaction design. These hands-on tasks enhanced my skills in building real-world web applications that are both functional and user-centered.
